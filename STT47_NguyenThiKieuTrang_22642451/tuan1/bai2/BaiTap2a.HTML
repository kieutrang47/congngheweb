        <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) <br></h1>
        <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant<br> 
        of mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler<br>
        was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and papers. His influence was felt in physics and<br>
        astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, <i>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</i> (1748) remained a standard textbook for well<br>
        over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <i>Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne</i> (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical<br>
        outline of the main physical theories of the time.<br></p>
        <p>One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps<br>
        best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula<br></p> 
        <p>cos(x) + isin(x) = e<sup>(ix)</sup><br></p> 
        <p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation<br></p>
        <p>e<sup>(&pi;<i>i</i>)</sup> + 1 = 0</p>
        <p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &pi;, e, and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement.</p>
        <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>
